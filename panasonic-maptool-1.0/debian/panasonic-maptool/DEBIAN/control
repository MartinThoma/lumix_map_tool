Description: Manage GPS information for Panasonic Lumix cameras.
 Panasonic offers GPS metadata to add to a SD card. This metadata can contain
 tourist information that might be useful for sightseeing. This maptool helps
 to copy the data from Lumix DVD to the SD card that is inserted into your
 computer (the camera has not to be connected).
